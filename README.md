# 😷 Face Mask Detection using CNN (TensorFlow & Keras)

A deep learning project that detects whether a person **is wearing a face mask or not** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
Built with **TensorFlow/Keras**, this project demonstrates end-to-end image classification — from data preprocessing to model training and prediction.

## 🧠 Project Overview

During the COVID-19 pandemic, face mask detection became an essential computer vision application.  
This project aims to automatically classify facial images into two categories:

- 😷 **With Mask**
- 😶 **Without Mask**

Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model learns to identify subtle differences in facial features between masked and unmasked faces.  
The trained model can later be integrated into real-time systems such as webcam apps or surveillance tools.
